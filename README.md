# DVD-Rental-Store-Database
## Description 
<p>
  My goal for this project was to analyze the database and answer a business question for the lab. We wanted to know which customers were our top sales performing so that the business could deliver special promotional offers to those members. 
  The scripts perform tasks such as table creation, database triggers, functions, and complex joins to display up-to-date data for the business.
